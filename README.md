# Babylon5_Stellaris
Babylon 5 Stellaris Mod (Development Branch)

Thank you for looking into the project! The aim is pretty simple. I'd like to incorporate as much of the Babylon 5 universe as I can into stellaris. I'm already well into the major races. Portraits, flags, fallen empires, species, and more. I would like to eventually call this a total conversion. Your help is appreciated.
